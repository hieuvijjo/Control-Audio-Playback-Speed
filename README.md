# Control-Audio-Playback-Speed.  
Anki addon https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1067025219  
Use [ button to increase audio speed.    
Use ] button to decrease audio speed.      
And set speed to normal with ```backspace``` .
 
Orignal Anki addon Control Audio Playback (Extended).  
https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1413404470   
Orignal addon can't adjust audio speed on Mac.    
I modified Audio_Controls.py so that it can work on Mac.    
Anki use mpv on both Mac and Linux, so this addon should also work on Linux

### For mpv    
List of Input Commands can be found
